#
## CYCLE_BRENT finds a cycle in an iterated mapping using Brent's method.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    Suppose we a repeatedly apply a function f(), starting with the argument
#    x0, then f(x0), f(f(x0)) and so on.  Suppose that the range of f is finite.
#    Then eventually the iteration must reach a cycle.  Once the cycle is reached,
#    succeeding values stay within that cycle.
#
#    Starting at x0, there is a "nearest element" of the cycle, which is
#    reached after MU applications of f.
#
#    Once the cycle is entered, the cycle has a length LAM, which is the number
#    of steps required to first return to a given value.
#
#    This function uses Brent's method to determine the values of MU and LAM,
#    given F and X0.
