def r8_chop ( place, x ):

#*****************************************************************************80
#
## R8_CHOP chops an R8 to a given number of binary places.
#
#  Example:
#
#    3.875 = 2 + 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8.
#
#    The following values would be returned for the 'chopped' value of
#    3.875:
#
#    PLACE  Value
#
#       1      2
#       2      3     = 2 + 1
#       3      3.5   = 2 + 1 + 1/2
#       4      3.75  = 2 + 1 + 1/2 + 1/4
#       5+     3.875 = 2 + 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8

#
#  Parameters:
#
#    Input, integer PLACE, the number of binary places to preserve.
#    PLACE = 0 means return the integer part of X.
#    PLACE = 1 means return the value of X, correct to 1/2.
#    PLACE = 2 means return the value of X, correct to 1/4.
#    PLACE = -1 means return the value of X, correct to 2.
#
#    Input, real X, the number to be chopped.
#
#    Output, real VALUE, the chopped number.
