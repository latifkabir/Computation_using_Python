def r8_fraction ( i, j ):

#*****************************************************************************80
#
## R8_FRACTION uses real arithmetic on an integer ratio.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    Given integer variables I and J, both FORTRAN and C will evaluate 
#    an expression such as "I/J" using what is called "integer division",
#    with the result being an integer.  It is often convenient to express
#    the parts of a fraction as integers but expect the result to be computed
#    using real arithmetic.  This function carries out that operation.
#
#  Example:
#
#       I     J   I/J  R8_FRACTION
#
#       1     2     0  0.5
#       7     4     1  1.75
#       8     4     2  2.00
#       9     4     2  2.25
