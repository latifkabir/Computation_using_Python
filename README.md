Computation using Python 
==================================

-   [args](args/args.html), a script which reports the command line
    arguments with which it was invoked;
-   [dolfin](dolfin/dolfin.html), scripts which are used with the DOLFIN
    library to set up and solve a wide variety of problems using the
    finite element method.
-   [hello](hello/hello.html), a script which prints "Hello, world!".
-   [hello\_mpi](hello_mpi/hello_mpi.html), a script which prints out
    "Hello, world!", carried out in parallel using MPI and MPI4PY.
-   [hump](hump/hump.html), a script which defines the data for a simple
    ice sheet experiment called "hump", and writes that data to a NETCDF
    file that can be used as input by a solver.
-   [prime\_mpi](prime_mpi/prime_mpi.html), a script which counts the
    number of primes between 1 and N, carried out in parallel using MPI
    and MPI4PY.
-   [prime\_serial](prime_serial/prime_serial.html), a script which
    counts the number of primes between 1 and N, and is intended as a
    starting point for a parallel version.
-   [py](py/py.html), a directory of example Python scripts.
-   [quad\_mpi](quad_mpi/quad_mpi.html), a script which approximates an
    integral using a quadrature rule, carried out in parallel using MPI
    and MPI4PY.
-   [quad\_serial](quad_serial/quad_serial.html), a script which applies
    a quadrature rule to estimate an integral, intended as a starting
    point for parallelization exercises.
-   [rkf45](rkf45/rkf45.html), a script which implements the
    Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg (RKF) solver for the approximate solution of an
    ordinary differential equation (ODE) system.
-   [search\_mpi](search_mpi/search_mpi.html), a script which searches
    integers between A and B for a solution J such that F(J)=C, carried
    out in parallel using MPI and MPI4PY.
-   [search\_serial](search_serial/search_serial.html), a script which
    searches integers between A and B for a solution J such that F(J)=C,
    intended as a starting point for parallelization exercises.
-   [sobol](sobol/sobol.html), a library which computes elements of a
    Sobol quasirandom sequence.
-   [sparse\_grid](sparse_grid/sparse_grid.html), some classes and
    functions defining sparse grids.
-   [table\_io](table_io/table_io.html), functions which read and write
    files (not very much here yet, and it doesn't work.)
-   [timestamp](timestamp/timestamp.html), a script which prints the
    current YMDHMS date as a timestamp.
